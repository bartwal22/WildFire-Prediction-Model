Wildfire Prediction Model (Machine Learning | R)

This project predicts the likelihood of wildfires using machine learning techniques based on environmental, geographical, and meteorological data.

Implemented Random Forest Classifier to classify wildfire occurrence with high accuracy.

Performed data preprocessing including missing value handling, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.

Applied hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV) to optimize model performance.

Visualized correlations between weather conditions, vegetation, and wildfire risk using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Built an interactive Streamlit interface for real-time wildfire prediction based on user input.

Dataset includes features such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, precipitation, and vegetation type.

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements:

Integration with real-time weather APIs for live wildfire prediction.

Deployment on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Heroku).

Implementation of deep learning models for improved accuracy.
